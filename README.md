WHO Life Expectancy (EDA Project)

Title: Global Health & Life Expectancy Analysis (WHO Data)

Description:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on World Health Organization (WHO) life expectancy data covering 180+ countries from 2000 to 2015.
This project uncovers how socioeconomic and health factors such as GDP, schooling, healthcare spending, and disease rates affect global life expectancy.

Key Highlights:

Cleaned and processed 2,900+ records of WHO data using Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly

Visualized correlations between GDP, schooling, alcohol use, BMI, and life expectancy

Compared trends between Developed vs. Developing countries

Built a simple linear regression to predict life expectancy

Derived actionable insights and policy recommendations for improving global health

Tools & Libraries:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Missingno, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebook
